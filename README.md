#Shopping List App

This is a shopping list app that allows for the creation of various lists with their own items.

###Background
I built this application to allow the storage of different shopping lists which is accessible on any device.

###Use Case
This application would be useful if you wanted to keep track of various shopping lists. As you gather each item, you can cross them off the list to keep track of what you have bought. A user can create various lists, each with their own set of items. Since this app uses local storage, you can reopen it at a later date and time to view any of the lists. Any items that where crossed off are also stored.

###Initial UX
The initial web and mobile wireframes are shown below:

###Prototype
You can see the application in action at the following link: https://jayzamazing.github.io/Shopping-List-App

###Technical
This project uses Html, CSS, Jquery, Javascript, Less, Webpack, and Babel. This app uses LocalStorage to store the data. This app is built using Babel, Uglify-js, and Webpack.

###Development Roadmap
This is v2.0.0 of the app. Future enhancements can be seen below:
* Add MongoDB for storage of data.
* Add Node.js for the backend for the app to communicate to.
* Add login system so each individual users lists are private.
